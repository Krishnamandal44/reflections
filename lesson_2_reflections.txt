What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

--> Without initialize a repository I cannot use the git features on that directory.
That is I cannot track the history of commits al all. So, by using 'git init' I should
initialize a git repository for the directory.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

--> Staging area is a temporary area where we add files that are going to commit.
It is an important concept because we can make a tracking history of each file
if we want, that makes it customizable and more convenient to use.
